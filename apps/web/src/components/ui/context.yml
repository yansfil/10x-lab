  A comprehensive collection of reusable UI components built with React, Radix UI primitives,
  and Tailwind CSS styling. This module provides a consistent design system foundation with
  accessible, customizable components including buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, dialogs, badges,
  checkboxes, and toast notifications. All components use class-variance-authority (CVA) for
  type-safe variant management and follow shadcn/ui patterns for modern React applications.

notes:
  - Components are built on top of Radix UI primitives for robust accessibility and behavior
  - Uses class-variance-authority (CVA) for managing component variants with TypeScript support
  - All components support className overrides via the cn utility for style customization
  - Following shadcn/ui component patterns for consistency and maintainability
  - Missing use-toast hook dependency needs to be implemented for toaster component
