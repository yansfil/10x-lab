  version: 0.0.1
  target: /apps/web/src/components/ui/button.tsx

what: |
  A flexible and customizable button component built with React and class-variance-authority (CVA).
  Provides multiple visual variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link) and
  size options (default, sm, lg, icon) with full TypeScript support. Supports polymorphic rendering
  through the asChild prop using Radix UI's Slot component.

use_when:
  - You need consistent button styling across your application with predefined variants
  - You want type-safe button props with TypeScript and automatic variant handling
  - You need to apply button styles to non-button elements (links, divs) using the asChild prop

do_not_use_when:
  - You need a completely custom button with unique styling outside the variant system
  - You're building a button group or toggle button that requires state management
  - You need specialized button behavior like file upload triggers or complex dropdown menus

constraints:
  - Requires Tailwind CSS for styling to work properly
  - Depends on class-variance-authority (CVA) for variant management
  - Uses Radix UI Slot component for polymorphic behavior
  - All color tokens must be defined in your Tailwind theme (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)

future:
  - Add loading state variant with spinner support
  - Implement button group composition for segmented controls
  - Add size variant for extra small (xs) and extra large (xl) buttons
  - Support for icon-only tooltips when using icon size variant
