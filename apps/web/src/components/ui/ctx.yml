what: |
  A comprehensive collection of reusable UI components built with React, Radix UI primitives,
  and Tailwind CSS styling. This module provides a consistent design system foundation with
  accessible, customizable components including buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, dialogs, badges,
  checkboxes, and toast notifications. All components use class-variance-authority (CVA) for
  type-safe variant management and follow shadcn/ui patterns for modern React applications.

use_when:
  - You need a consistent design system for your application
  - You want to use shadcn/ui components
  - You need accessible, keyboard-navigable UI components

do_not_use_when:
  - You need custom components outside the shadcn/ui design system
  - You're building a native mobile application
  - You require components with built-in server-side rendering optimizations
