# 10x Lab

A playground for context growing development experiments.

1. Making context a first-class artifact (not a comment)
2. Enforcing synchronization mechanically (not manually)
3. Creating queryable indexes (not search)
   
The key insight: Context is not a side effect of code - it's a co-evolving entity. When you treat it as such, you unlock:


## Purpose

This project explores context-driven development methodologies, focusing on building software that adapts and responds to its operational context, user needs, and environmental constraints.

## Overview

Context-driven development emphasizes:
- Understanding the specific context in which software operates
- Adapting solutions to real-world constraints and requirements
- Iterative refinement based on contextual feedback
- Pragmatic decision-making over rigid methodologies
