# 10x Lab

A playground for context-driven development experiments.

## Purpose

This project explores context-driven development methodologies, focusing on building software that adapts and responds to its operational context, user needs, and environmental constraints.

## Overview

Context-driven development emphasizes:
- Understanding the specific context in which software operates
- Adapting solutions to real-world constraints and requirements
- Iterative refinement based on contextual feedback
- Pragmatic decision-making over rigid methodologies
