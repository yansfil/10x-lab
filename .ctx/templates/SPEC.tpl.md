## Story Overview

### Problem Statement
*What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?*

### Success Metrics
*How will we know if this story is successful?*
- [ ] Metric 1: [e.g., User can complete task in < 3 clicks]
- [ ] Metric 2: [e.g., 80% of users understand story without documentation]

## üéØ User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

### Acceptance Scenarios
*Use Given/When/Then format*
1. **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- What happens when [edge case]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
- What if [resource limitation]?

### Out of Scope
*Explicitly list what this story will NOT do*
- Will not support [X]
- Does not include [Y]

## üìã Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
*Each must be testable and unambiguous*
- üî¥ **FR-001**: System MUST [specific behavior]
- üî¥ **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to [specific action]
- üî¥ **FR-003**: System MUST [constraint or rule]

### Optional/Future Requirements
*Nice-to-have storys for later phases*
- üü¢ **FR-OPT-001**: System MAY [optional feature]

### Non-Functional Requirements
*Performance, security, usability constraints*
- üü° **NFR-001**: [Performance requirement]
- üü° **NFR-002**: [Security requirement]

## üîç Clarifications & Decisions
*All clarifications have been resolved through the requirements gathering phase*

### Resolved Clarifications
| #   | Question         | Resolution              | Impact                     |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 001 | [Question asked] | [Clear answer received] | [How this shaped the spec] |
| 002 | [Question asked] | [Clear answer received] | [How this shaped the spec] |

### Key Decisions Made
| Decision   | Rationale         | Based On                |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Decision] | [Why this choice] | [User clarification #X] |
| [Decision] | [Why this choice] | [User clarification #Y] |

### Clarification Summary
‚úÖ **All critical clarifications resolved**
‚úÖ **No ambiguities remain**
‚úÖ **Spec ready for implementation**
