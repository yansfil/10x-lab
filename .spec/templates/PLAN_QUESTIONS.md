üìù Pre-Development Design Checklist (for AI Agent Development)

Use this guide before starting any implementation work.
‚úÖ Sections 1-3 are mandatory.
üü° Sections 4‚Äì5 are optional ‚Äî skip them for simple or low-impact changes.

‚∏ª

1. Scope & Impact (Required)
	‚Ä¢	In-scope: What exactly will this change cover?
	‚Ä¢	Out-of-scope: What will not be touched by this change?
	‚Ä¢	Impact areas: Which modules, files, classes, or functions are affected?
	‚Ä¢	Re-use: Which existing code, libraries, or infrastructure can we reuse?

‚∏ª

2. Design Overview (Required)
	‚Ä¢	Architecture / Flow: How does the system change after this update?
(Include a simple diagram if possible.)
	‚Ä¢	Interfaces: Function signatures, API specs, event/message formats.
	‚Ä¢	Data Model Changes: Any additions or modifications to entities/schemas?
	‚Ä¢	External Systems: If any integrations are involved, clarify:
	‚Ä¢	Request/response schema
	‚Ä¢	Timeout/retry/idempotency policies
	‚Ä¢	Authentication/authorization/rate-limit rules

‚∏ª

3. Test & Verification (Required)
	‚Ä¢	Acceptance Criteria: How will we know this change is successful?
	‚Ä¢	Test Plan: What kinds of tests will be added or updated?

‚∏ª

4. Alternatives & Decisions (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Considered Alternatives: Which approaches were explored?
	‚Ä¢	Decision & Trade-offs: Why was this approach chosen?
	‚Ä¢	ADR Needed?: Should this be captured in an Architecture Decision Record?

‚∏ª

5. Risks & Open Questions (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Risks: Potential regressions, edge cases, or side effects to watch for.
	‚Ä¢	Open Questions: Any unresolved issues or dependencies?
