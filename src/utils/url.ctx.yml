  target: /src/utils/url.ts

what: |
  Comprehensive URL manipulation utilities for parsing, building,
  validating, and transforming URLs and query parameters. Handles
  both absolute and relative URLs with robust error handling.

use_when:
  - You need to parse, build, or manipulate query parameters in URLs
  - You need to validate URLs or extract specific parts (domain, extension, hash)
  - You need to join URL paths, convert relative to absolute URLs, or encode URLs safely
  - You're working with URL-related operations and need consistent, tested utilities

do_not_use_when:
  - You only need simple URL operations that native URL API can handle directly
  - You're working in an environment without URL API support (very old browsers)
  - You need streaming URL parsing for extremely large URLs (this loads full URL in memory)

future:
  - Add URL normalization (canonical URL generation)
  - Add support for URL templates (RFC 6570)
  - Add bulk query parameter operations for performance
