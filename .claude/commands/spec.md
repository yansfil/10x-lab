You are helping with collaborative feature specification. Your role is to systematically extract requirements, identify ambiguities, and create a clear specification focused on WHAT needs to be done and WHY (not HOW).

# Initial Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

# Critical Context
- **Purpose**: Create an unambiguous specification that defines WHAT the feature does and WHY it matters
- **Focus**: Business requirements, user value, acceptance criteria (no technical implementation)
- **Reference Documents**:
  - `.spec/templates/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`: Final document structure
  - `.spec/templates/SPEC_QUESTIONS.md`: Comprehensive question checklist

# Workflow
Execute these phases systematically:

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Analysis & Questions

**Goal**: Understand the request and identify ALL clarifications needed.

### 1-1. Codebase Exploration (if applicable)
1. Search for similar features and patterns
2. Identify existing conventions
3. Note integration points and constraints

### 1-2. Generate Questions
Using `.spec/templates/SPEC_QUESTIONS.md`, systematically identify:
- ‚úÖ **Answer directly** if information is clear or found in codebase
- ‚ùì **Flag for clarification** if ambiguous or missing
- üí° **Suggest default** for non-critical items

**Priority levels:**
- üî¥ **Critical**: Blocks spec completion
- üü° **Important**: Affects user experience
- üü¢ **Optional**: Can use reasonable defaults

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Interactive Clarification

**STOP AND WAIT for user input**

### Iteration Loop Process:
1. **Present** questions organized by priority
2. **Receive** user input and answers
3. **Update** clarification tracker:
   - Mark items as resolved with answers
   - Add any new clarifications discovered
   - Update priority if needed
4. **Check** remaining critical items:
   - IF critical questions remain ‚Üí Return to step 1
   - ELSE ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 3

### Clarification Presentation Format:
```markdown
## üìä Clarification Status
| Priority | Total | Resolved | Pending |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| üî¥ Critical | X | Y | Z |
| üü° Important | X | Y | Z |
| üü¢ Optional | X | Y | Z |

## üî¥ Critical (Blocks progress)
Must be answered to proceed:

1. **[#001] [Question]**
   - Context: [Why this matters]
   - Option A: [suggestion with implications]
   - Option B: [alternative with implications]
   - Impact: [What this affects]

## üü° Important (Affects solution)
Would significantly improve the specification:

1. **[#002] [Question]**
   - Context: [Why this matters]
   - Suggested: [default with rationale]
   - Impact: [What this affects]

## üü¢ Optional (Nice to have)
Using these defaults unless specified:

1. **[#003] [Question]**
   - Default: [assumed value]
   - Rationale: [why this default]
```

### Clarification Resolution Tracking:
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Resolved Clarifications
| ID | Question | Answer | Impact |
|----|----------|--------|---------|
| #001 | [Question] | [User's answer] | [How this affects spec] |
```

Continue iterating until all critical questions are resolved.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Spec Organization & Document Generation

**Goal**: Determine spec structure and create comprehensive documentation

### 3-1. Determine Spec Structure
Ask user: "How should we organize this requirement?"

#### Option A: Single Spec
- One comprehensive `spec.md` for the entire feature
- Best for: Small, cohesive features

#### Option B: Multi-Spec
- `overview.md` + multiple `spec-*.md` files
- Best for: Complex features with independent components
- Examples:
  - By domain: `spec-auth.md`, `spec-profile.md`
  - By layer: `spec-frontend.md`, `spec-backend.md`
  - By module: `spec-payment.md`, `spec-notification.md`

#### Option C: Phased Spec
- `overview.md` + phase-based specs
- Best for: Features requiring incremental delivery
- Examples: `spec-phase1-mvp.md`, `spec-phase2-enhanced.md`

### 3-2. Generate Specification Documents

#### Always Create:
1. `overview.md` using OVERVIEW_TEMPLATE (for all structures)

#### Then Based on Structure:

##### For Single Spec:
2. Create `spec.md` using SPEC_TEMPLATE
3. Fill all sections with clarified requirements

##### For Multi-Spec:
2. Create individual `spec-*.md` files using SPEC_TEMPLATE
3. Ensure cross-references between specs
4. Update overview.md with all spec links

### 3-3. Generate Implementation Plans
For each spec document, create corresponding plan:
- Single: `spec.md` ‚Üí `plan.md`
- Multi: `spec-feature.md` ‚Üí `plan-feature.md`

Use PLAN_TEMPLATE with:
- Reference to corresponding spec
- Technical implementation details
- Specific file changes
- Task breakdown

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Validation & Refinement

Review the spec against the template checklist:
- All sections completed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- Requirements are testable
- Scope is bounded

### 3-4. Save Structure
Save to `.spec/specs/[YYYYMMDD-feature-name]/`:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview.md          # (always created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md             # (if single) OR
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec-*.md           # (if multi)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plan*.md            # corresponding plans
```

# Remember
- This is collaborative - iterate with the user
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, never HOW
- Mark all ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Think like a tester - how would you verify each requirement?
- The spec is the contract - make it complete
