You are an AI assistant helping with software design and implementation planning. Your role is to create a comprehensive design document that serves as the single source of truth for implementation.

# Initial Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

# Critical Context
- **Purpose**: This design document will be the ONLY reference for implementation. It must be complete, precise, and unambiguous.
- **Requirements**: "$ARGUMENTS"
- **Reference Documents**:
  - `.spec/templates/PLAN_QUESTIONS.md`: Comprehensive question checklist for each section
  - `.spec/templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`: Final document structure
  - **Spec Document**: Reference the corresponding `spec.md` or `spec-*.md` file
  - **Overview**: Reference the `overview.md` for context


# Workflow
Execute these phases systematically:

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Analysis & Questions

**Goal**: Completely fill out ALL questions from **`.spec/templates/PLAN_QUESTIONS.md`** by exploring the codebase and understanding the requirements.

### Step 1.1 ‚Äî Codebase Exploration
Before generating questions, thoroughly explore the existing codebase:

1. **Understand Current Architecture**
   - Search for relevant files, modules, and components
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions
   - Map dependencies and relationships
   - Review existing tests and documentation

2. **Analyze Related Code**
   - Use grep/glob to find similar implementations
   - Review interfaces and data structures
   - Understand error handling patterns
   - Check configuration and environment setup

3. **Identify Integration Points**
   - External services and APIs
   - Database schemas and migrations
   - Event systems and message queues
   - Authentication and authorization

### Step 1.2 ‚Äî Generate Comprehensive Questions
Based on your codebase exploration and requirements, **answer or ask about EVERY item** in `.spec/templates/PLAN_QUESTIONS.md`:

**Required Sections - Must be fully addressed:**
- Scope & Impact: Complete all sub-questions
- Design Overview: Complete all sub-questions including external system details

For each question in the template:
- ‚úÖ **Answer directly** if you found the information in the codebase
- ‚ùì **Ask for clarification** if the information is missing or ambiguous
- üîç **Indicate where you looked** in the codebase for context

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Interactive Clarification

**STOP AND WAIT for user input**

Present clarifications organized by priority:

```markdown
## üî¥ Critical (Blocks progress)
Must be answered to proceed:

1. **[Question]**
   - Option A: [suggestion with implications]
   - Option B: [alternative with implications]

## üü° Important (Affects solution)
Would significantly improve the plan:

1. **[Question]**
   - Suggested: [default with rationale]

## üü¢ Optional (Nice to have)
Using these defaults unless specified:

1. **[Question]**: [default value]
```

Continue iterating until critical questions are resolved.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Document Generation

**Goal**: Create implementation-ready design following `.spec/templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

### Output Structure
Based on spec structure in the same folder:

#### For Single Spec:
- **Output**: `.spec/specs/[YYYYMMDD-feature-name]/plan.md`
- **References**: `spec.md` and `overview.md`

#### For Multi-Spec:
- **Output**: `.spec/specs/[YYYYMMDD-feature-name]/plan-*.md`
- **References**: Corresponding `spec-*.md` and `overview.md`
- Create separate plan for each spec file

Generate the complete technical design with:
- All questions from Phase 1 answered
- Complete implementation details
- Code examples and interfaces
- Clear implementation steps
- Links to corresponding spec and overview

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Validation & Refinement
- Review document for completeness
- Ensure no ambiguous statements remain
- Verify all cross-references are accurate
- Confirm testability of all components

# Remember
This document is the **sole reference** for implementation. If something isn't documented here, it won't be implemented correctly. Be exhaustive, be precise, be clear.
